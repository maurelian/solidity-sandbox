  // binary search is used.
  // The functions in this contract are ordered by the value of their function selectors from lowest to highest.
  // Try running `forge test -m test_4` with and without the last function commented out.
  // You'll see that adding the 5th function actually makes test_4() cheaper, because instead of
  // being the 4th selector in the search, it becomes the second function after the initial
  // branch check is performed.
